# xDEVS

## Introduction

This library provides a set of C++, JAVA and Python classes that provide an event-driven simulation interface. The interface also follows the formalism Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS). The project final goal is to elaborate the fastest DEVS simulation interface with capacity to simulated models in virtual an real time, and run simulation in sequential (single thread), parallel (multi-threaded) and distributed (not shared memory) architectures. Initial research in the xDEVS architecture can be found in [Reconsidering the performance of DEVS modeling and simulation environments using the DEVStone benchmark](http://doi.org/10.1177/0037549717690447). There are three main branches: c++, java and python each one offering the equivalent simulation interface (but not the same) for each programming language.

## Top features

- PDEVS Modeling and Simulation formalism
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Support for sequential, parallel and distributed (this last feature only in JAVA and Python, for now) architectures.
- Good performance, compared to other simulation engines

## Quick start

Switch to the corresponding branch. A README file will be found to start with minimal examples and demos.
